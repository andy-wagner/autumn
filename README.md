Autumn is a Java parser combinator library written with an unmatched feature
set:

- Bundles pre-defined parsers and combinators for most common use cases
- Write your own parsers with regular Java code
- Support for both scannerless parsing and a separate lexing/tokenization step
- Associativity & precedence support for operators
- Left-recursion support
- Context-sensitive parsing **!!**
- Reasonably fast (3x slower than ANTLR)
- Thoroughly documented
- Small & clean codebase

/**
 * A visitor interface for the built-in implementations of {@link Parser}.
 *
 * <p>To write a visitor for the built-in parser implementations, it suffices to implement this
 * interface. The built-in parsers already override {@link Parser#accept(ParserVisitor)} to call
 * {@code visitor.visit(this);} â€”  which will select the right overload for the specific parser.
 *
 * <p>To handle custom parsers (say {@code MyParser}), things are slightly more complex. You must
 * first create a sub-interface extending {@code ParserVisitor} (say {@code MyParserVisitor}),
 * adding a method {@code void visit(MyParser parser);}. Next, {@code MyParser} must override {@link
 * Parser#accept(ParserVisitor)} to call {@code ((MyParserVisitor)visitor).visit(this);}. Now all
 * visitors that implement {@code MyParserVisitor} will work with all built-in parsers as well as
 * {@code MyParser}.
 *
 * <p>This is not the end of the story, as you may want to compose visitors for multiple parsers.
 * The trick is to actually implement {@code ParserVisitor} and its sub-interfaces as interfaces,
 * then to compose these implementations with a single class.
 *
 * <p>As an example, consider this hierarchy:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * interface ParserVisitor
 *  + interface MyParserVisitor     (extends ParserVisitor)
 *  + interface _VisitorA           (extends ParserVisitor)
 *     + class VisitorA       (extends _VisitorA)
 *  + interface _VisitorB           (extends ParserVisitor)
 *     + class VisitorB       (extends _VisitorB)
 *
 * interface _VisitorMyParserA extends _VisitorA, MyParserVisitor
 *  + final class VisitorMyParserA  (extends VisitorA implements _VisitorMyParserA)
 *
 * interface _VisitorMyParserB extends _VisitorB, MyParserVisitor
 *  + final class VisitorMyParserB  (extends VisitorA implements _VisitorMyParserB)
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Within it, we have an interface to handle our custom parser {@code MyParser}: {@code
 * MyParserVisitor}. We also have two visitor implementations that do not support {@code MyParser}:
 * {@code _VisitorA} and {@code _VisitorB}, which might be coming from some library. Note that those
 * are interfaces, precisely so that they can be composed.
 *
 * <p>{@code VisitorA} and {@code VisitorB} are instantiable versions of these implementations.
 * Typically, these classes will be almost empty: the only thing you must do is to supply storage for
 * the state of the visitors. (e.g. storage for {@link VisitorFirstParsers#firsts()}).
 *
 * <p>Note that it's a convention to use an underscore (_) in front of the name of the
 * "implementation interfaces" and to use the same name without the underscore for the corresponding
 * instantiable version. Another convention we use is to have visitors' names (both interfaces and
 * classes) start with "Visitor".
 *
 * <p>Now, if you want to use {@code _VisitorA} with {@code MyParserVisitor}, you need to compose
 * them and supply an {@code void accept(MyParser)} overload. This is what {@code _VisitorMyParserA}
 * does, and similarly with {@code _VisitorMyParserB} for {@code _VisitorB}. We also supply
 * the corresponding instantiable classes. Note that if you're not going to expose your code as a
 * library, you can skip the interface step ({@code _VisitorMyParserA}) and immediately implement
 * {@code _VisitorA} and {@code MyParserVisitor} in a class!
 *
 * <p>Note that we make {@code _VisitorMyParserA} extends {@code VisitorA}: this simply avoids
 * duplicating the storage definitions already made in {@code VisitorA}.
 *
 * <p>These composition hierarchies can even get hairier, but everything will keep working as long
 * as each method is only overriden in a single interface of the hiearchy.
 *
 * <p>Finally, note that the visitor interface <b>only</b> allows specialization of behaviour based
 * on the parser type. It does not perform any kind of grammar traversal on your behalf. Of course,
 * for some visitors, such a traversal might be a part of the specialized functionality, but {@code
 * ParseVisitor} offers no support for this. However, {@link ParserWalker} has the logic to traverse
 * the grammar (which is essentially a directed parser graph whose edges are given by {@link
 * Parser#children()}. As an example of how visitors and walkers can work in tandem, see {@link
 * WellFormednessChecker} and its implementation.
